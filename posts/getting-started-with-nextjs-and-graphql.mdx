<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", margin: "2em 0 1em" }}>Introduction</h3>

In this article we will quickly setup our NextJS application with GraphQL (Apollo Server). If you not familiar with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), I highly recommend you to read and get started with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

<br />

<h4 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", margin: "1em 0" }}>Setup</h4>

If you haven't setup your NextJS application yet, go ahead and create your application.

```
	npx create-next-app mountain-view
```

Once you are done with this, we will begin adding our graphql dependencies. We will need to install `@apollo/server`, `graphql` and `@as-integrations/next`, which allow us to run an Apollo server in our application:

```
	npm install @apollo/server graphql @as-integrations/next
```

<br />

<h4 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", margin: "1em 0" }}>Structure</h4>

If you are familiar with graphql, we know that we have two main components in any
graphql application. That would be `resolvers` and `schema`. Also we need to create
our graphql end point, this would also allow us to access our playground.

```
	├── apollo
	|  ├── resolvers
	|	 |  └── index.js
	|	 └── schemas
	|	    └── index.js
	└── pages
	   ├── api
	   |  └── graphql.js
	   └── index.js
```

<br />
Let's create a simple query that has a simple method that returns all posts. In `api/schemas/index.js`

```graphql
export const typeDefs = `#graphql
  type Post {
    id: ID
		name: String
    description: String
    content: String
  }

  type Query {
    getPosts: [Post]
  }
`;
```

<br />
We need to create resolvers for our new two methods, we can use github api to return
these posts In `api/resolvers/index.js`

```javascript
export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getPosts: async () => {
      try {
        const posts = [
          {
            id: "random-id-7322371",
            name: "GraphQL Post",
            description: "This is a blog post.",
          },
        ];
        return posts;
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    },
  },
};
```

and that's pretty much all we need, now if you start your NextJS application and go to /api/graphql you will see this.

Happy coding!
